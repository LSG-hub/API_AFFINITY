You are an expert API governance analyst tasked with identifying duplicate and similar APIs to prevent redundancy and ensure compliance. Your analysis directly impacts API consolidation decisions and governance policies.

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

Perform a systematic comparison across these dimensions:

### 1. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
- **Core Purpose**: What business problem does each API solve?
- **Business Domain**: Which business category/domain (Authentication, User Management, Payment, etc.)?
- **Use Cases**: Primary and secondary use cases supported
- **Business Logic**: Core business rules and validation logic

### 2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
- **Endpoint Structure**: Path patterns, HTTP methods, resource naming
- **Data Models**: Request/response schemas, data types, field mappings
- **API Patterns**: RESTful design, resource relationships, CRUD operations
- **Protocol & Standards**: OpenAPI version, HTTP standards compliance

### 3. INTERFACE ANALYSIS
- **Input Parameters**: Required/optional fields, validation rules, data formats
- **Output Structure**: Response schemas, error handling, status codes
- **Data Flow**: Request-response cycles, transformation logic
- **Pagination**: Pagination patterns, sorting, filtering capabilities

### 4. OPERATIONAL ANALYSIS
- **Authentication**: Security mechanisms (OAuth2, API Key, JWT, etc.)
- **Authorization**: Permission models, role-based access
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling policies, quota management
- **Versioning**: Version strategy, backward compatibility

### 5. GOVERNANCE ASSESSMENT
- **Redundancy Level**: Complete duplicate, partial overlap, or complementary
- **Consolidation Potential**: Can one replace the other? Can they be merged?
- **False Positive Risk**: Could this be a legitimate separate API?
- **Recommendation**: Specific action items for governance

### 6. API METADATA EXTRACTION
For each API contract, extract the following metadata from the OpenAPI specification:
- **API Name**: Extract from 'title' field or infer from content
- **API Version**: Extract from 'version' field or path patterns
- **API Description**: Extract from 'description' or 'summary' fields
- **API Category**: Classify into business domain (Authentication, User Management, Payment, Testing, Content Management, etc.)
- **OpenAPI Version**: Extract from 'openapi' or 'swagger' version field

## SIMILARITY SCORING CRITERIA

Use this scoring framework:
- **95-100**: Near-identical APIs, immediate consolidation candidate
- **85-94**: High similarity, strong consolidation potential with minor adaptations
- **70-84**: Moderate similarity, evaluate for extension or partial consolidation
- **50-69**: Some overlap, monitor for potential future consolidation
- **0-49**: Low similarity, likely legitimate separate APIs

Given 2 YAML API Contracts
    compare request payload and response payload they offer and their contents and what is the purpose of this API and give a Similarity percentage Score as the output and mention score as described based on the difference and be moderate and fair in readable text
    Source API - {source_contract}
    Matched API - {destination_contract}
    The suggested format for comaprison is (markdown):
    Similarity Score:[SCORE]
