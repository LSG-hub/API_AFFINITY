# Enhanced Zero-Cost API Similarity Analyzer v2

## 🚀 What's New in v2

The enhanced version addresses the critical gap identified in functional similarity analysis by incorporating **comprehensive business context understanding**. Based on extensive research of industry-standard API patterns and vocabularies, v2 provides significantly more accurate similarity assessments.

### Key Improvements

#### 🎯 **Enhanced Functional Analysis** (35% weight, up from 25%)
- **Business Domain Classification**: 9 comprehensive domains with 500+ industry-standard keywords
- **Operation Intent Analysis**: Classifies operations by business purpose, not just HTTP methods
- **Business Process Flow Recognition**: Identifies sequential business patterns
- **Domain-Specific Pattern Matching**: Recognizes industry-specific API designs

#### 📊 **Improved Scoring Accuracy**
- **Domain Similarity (40% of functional)**: Heavily penalizes cross-domain comparisons
- **Intent Similarity (30% of functional)**: Distinguishes business operations from CRUD
- **Flow Similarity (20% of functional)**: Recognizes business process sequences
- **CRUD Similarity (10% of functional)**: Reduced weight for basic operations

### Problem Solved: Functional Similarity Gap

**Original Issue**: Banking API vs KYC API scored 69.8% functional similarity (vs LLM: 35%)
**v2 Expected**: ~25-35% functional similarity (aligned with human assessment)

**Why the improvement**:
- Different business domains now heavily penalized
- Operation intent analysis distinguishes financial operations from data CRUD
- Business context understanding prevents false positives

## 📊 Business Domain Examples

### Banking Domain Detection
```yaml
# API with these patterns = Banking Domain
paths:
  /aisp/account-consents:     # PSD2 pattern
  /accounts/{accountId}/transactions:  # Banking entity
operations:
  - consent-setup            # Banking operation
  - balance-inquiry          # Banking function
fields:
  - authorization           # Financial auth
  - x-fapi-customer-ip     # FAPI standard
```

### KYC Domain Detection  
```yaml
# API with these patterns = KYC/Compliance Domain
paths:
  /api/v2/tables/leads/records:  # Data management pattern
operations:
  - lead-create              # Lead management
  - record-update            # CRUD operation
fields:
  - business_name            # KYC field
  - compliance_status        # Compliance field
```

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Domain-Specific Penalties
```python
# Cross-domain penalty matrix
banking ↔ kyc_compliance     = 0.6 similarity (related)
banking ↔ ecommerce         = 0.0 similarity (unrelated)
healthcare ↔ logistics      = 0.0 similarity (unrelated)
```

### Intent Classification
```python
operation_intents = {
    'data_access': ['get', 'list', 'retrieve', 'query'],
    'business_process': ['authorize', 'approve', 'verify', 'process'],
    'data_modification': ['create', 'update', 'delete'],
    'system_operation': ['sync', 'backup', 'configure']
}
```

### Flow Pattern Recognition
```python
business_flows = {
    'financial_transaction': ['consent', 'authorize', 'process', 'settle'],
    'user_onboarding': ['register', 'verify', 'approve', 'activate'],
    'ecommerce_purchase': ['browse', 'cart', 'checkout', 'fulfill']
}
```
