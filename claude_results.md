# API Affinity Analysis - Claude Edition

## What?
Similarity analysis between KYC API and Account/Transaction API using enhanced Graph Neural Networks.

## Overall Score: 69.8%
**Category**: Some overlap  
**Recommendation**: Monitor for future consolidation

## How?
### Multi-Dimensional Analysis Components:
- **Functionality Analysis (70%)**: 80.9% similarity
  - CRUD operation detection and matching
  - RESTful pattern recognition
  - API operation semantics
  - Parameter and response analysis
  
- **Semantic Understanding (20%)**: 36.4% similarity
  - Sentence transformer embeddings
  - Text-based API description analysis
  - Endpoint naming conventions
  
- **Structural Analysis (10%)**: 58.8% similarity
  - Graph topology comparison
  - Node/edge counts and density
  - Basic structural metrics

## Accuracy & Metrics

### Weightage Configuration:
- **GNN Embedding (Functionality)**: 70% weight
- **Semantic Analysis**: 20% weight  
- **Structural Analysis**: 10% weight

### Key Metrics:
- **Schema Alignment**: 0.2% (Very low data structure compatibility)
- **Graph Density**: API1: 0.008, API2: 0.003
- **Feature Dimensions**: 100+ features per node
- **GNN Architecture**: 3-layer network with 64 hidden dimensions

### Enhanced Features:
- **CRUD Detection**: Automatic classification of Create/Read/Update/Delete operations
- **RESTful Patterns**: Recognition of standard REST conventions
- **Weighted Relationships**: Edge importance based on semantic relevance
- **Deep Schema Comparison**: Recursive property analysis with fuzzy matching

## Why These Results?
1. **High Functionality Similarity (80.9%)**: Both APIs handle similar business operations
2. **Low Semantic Similarity (36.4%)**: Different naming conventions and descriptions
3. **Moderate Structural Similarity (58.8%)**: Different graph structures but similar complexity
4. **Very Low Schema Alignment (0.2%)**: Different data models and structures

## Recommendation
**Monitor for future consolidation** - APIs serve different domains but have overlapping functionality patterns.
